design and then write a Sensorimotor Inference Engine. A Sensorimotor Inference Engine is a sophisticated program (probably an AI type-program) that infers how sensory input changes based upon it's motor output. It is necessarily in a feedback loop with it environment and therefore tends towards reverse-engineering the entire environment it finds itself in. For example, a Sensorimotor Inference Engine given a Rubik's Cube will naturally explore the behaviors it can perform on the Rubik's Cube and begin to deduce how the puzzle works, in a generic way such that it can deduce how any puzzle (or environment) works. The reason a Sensorimotor Inference Engine is useful is because given the state of the fully observable environment, it knows short path to change the state into any desired state. Thus one can give it a goal state and it will manipulate the enivronment until the environment matches the goal state. I want you to design a simple version of a Sensorimotor Inference Engine and write the code, in python necessarily to make it work. I will provide guidance since I've given this much thought and know some of the principles by which it might work efficiently.
