try to run it.
troubleshoot disconnection issue (pubsub?) reconnecting?
website should show raw data and prediction graph, with current predictions
  new table for history 
  (30 days / observations max) (job to clear out)
  transfer old data to history on updates
  query to pull
  front end visual
DONE build a pitch deck (story first, idea second)
  satori story
    hi, represent satori, beta, seed round
    idea in 2012
      build a system that can predict everything
      a network could watch everything (anything can affect anything)
      blockchain
      automated machine learning
    attempted with pure solution (proof of prediction)
    gala games and node architecture
      legal interface
    tried again november 2021
    automated machine learning engine 3 months
    node, supporting servers
    almost to beta release
    nodes are running
    no real blockchain integration yet
  idea
    look, we're predicting everything,
      chain will predct major things (public good)
    subscribe to the future of anything (market good)
      most unbiased predictions because we'll have the biggest future predicting network.
  ask

decide what to do about original histories for relay streams... 
  should be a link or series of links and python script which processes them one at a time? 
    class that has initialize(), getNext() and isDone() -> save to disk, first, then ipfs will pick it up
    also format the input form.

The node should make a prediction on startup if the last prediction it made was after a different observation than the current...
